## Hi there 👋 I'm Ekaterina 

I’m a Data Analyst with ~1 year of hands-on project experience and a 4-year background in marketing communications within the tech industry.  

I moved into data analytics after working closely with internal company data and analytics teams to develop data-driven communications. Through this experience, I realized I wanted to go deeper: not just communicate insights, but uncover them myself and support data-driven business decision-making.

## 🛠 Stack & Skills
- Python (pandas, NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- SQL (data extraction, joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries/CTEs)
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- BI & visualization (Yandex DataLens, Tableau, Power BI)
- Spreadsheets (MS Excel, Google Sheets)
- Statistics, hypothesis testing, A/B testing
